It shares carrier data from different backend systems with agents.

Powered by CoreCONNECT, data from a carrier's incompatible backend systems can become one in LifetimeAGENT. Agents then have instantaneous access to all key documents from the insurer.


How it can be used by your team:

- Any team from the insurer's home office can communicate through notifications on the front page when agents login.
- Data and analytics teams can continue using their current systems to input information that agents need to know, and CoreCONNECT manages translating system data into the LifetimeAGENT product—helping to ease the load for IT.
